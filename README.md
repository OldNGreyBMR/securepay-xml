Plugin Details:
-----------------------------------------------------------
This plugin enables support for credit-card transactions via the SecurePay (AU) payment gateway.

It supports the following kinds of transactions: (** = not implemented)
	Standard Credit
	Preauthorise **
	Advice (complete) **
	Refund **
	Reverse (Void) **

Manual Installation instructions:
=================================
These instructions assume that you already have Zen Cart installed, configured and operational.

1. Extract the Installer archive to a temporary location.

2. Create a new folder named "securepayxml" in your zen-cart payment modules folder:
	 /zencart_path/includes/modules/payment/securepayxml
	
	(Substitute "/zencart_path" for the path to your Zen Cart installation)

3. Copy the files under the "includes" directory into their respective paths in your Zen Cart installation:
	[	(Substitute "/zencart_path" for the path to your Zen Cart installation)]
    
	"includes/modules/payment/securepayxml.php" to "/zencart_path/includes/modules/payment/"
	"includes/modules/payment/securepay_xml_api.php" to "/zencart_path/includes/modules/payment/"
	"includes/modules/payment/securepayxml/securepayxml_admin_notification.php" to "/zencart_path/includes/modules/payment/securepayxml"
	"includes/languages/english/modules/payment/securepayxml.php" to "/zencart_path/includes/languages/english/modules/payment/"
	"includes/languages/english/modules/payment/securepay_xml_api.php" to "/zencart_path/includes/languages/english/modules/payment/"
		
	[ (Change YOUR_TEMPLATE to the name of your template folder) ]
    
    "includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/css"
    "includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/images"
    "includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/css"
    and copy the three folders (css, images and templates) to YOUR_TEMPLATE folder
    
    
4. Configure the module via the Zen Cart admin interface.
	-Log-in
	-Navigate to Modules->Payment
	-Select "SecurePay XML API (AU)", click "Install"
	-Select "Configure", enter your SecurePay merchant identifier and password, configure as desired, then click "update"
	
5. Test the module to ensure that everything is working correctly (set it to "Test" and try a transaction. See "Test Gateway Operation" for more details).

6. The SecurePay XML API payment module is now installed. Set it to "Live" when your account is activated, and you are ready to receive payments through SecurePay.

Test Gateway Operation
======================
In test mode, your transactions will be sent to the the SecurePay Test Gateway. 
** The Merchant ID and Password for the test gateway are NOT the same as the Merchant ID and Password for your live Merchant Account. 
A test Merchant ID and Transaction password are listed below.

You can test with the following settings:
-----------------------------------------
Merchant ID = ABC0001 
Merchant Password = abc123 
Test Mode = Yes 

When processing transactions, if the transaction is would otherwise give a 000 "Approved" response
code, the Test gateway will return the cents portion of the transaction amount as the response code
(i.e. a transaction amount of $1.05 will result in a "(05): Do Not Honour" response).

To achieve an "approved" test transaction, ensure the total transaction amount (including tax and
shipping costs) is a round dollar value (i.e. $1.00)
